Xinhai Han is currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Oceanography, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His primary research focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence with extreme climate analysis.

His research interests mainly include:
- Utilizing GANs to improve observational data accuracy and reconstruct 2D/3D tropical cyclone structures.
- Implementing GANs and RNNs for spatiotemporal sequence prediction of Western Pacific tropical cyclones and sea surface winds.
- Applying GCNs to predict storm surges caused by tropical cyclones, aiding in disaster preparedness and response.
